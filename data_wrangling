Data Wrangling

The data for this project came from the Social Security Administration 
and is presented to the public as an act of transparency and to use for 
various research purposes.  As a result, there is a maintainer of this 
data to remove errors and keep it tidied up.  As a result, there were 
only two state codes with missing values, Puerto Rico and Guam.  Since 
there was hardly any data to either of these rows they were omitted 
from the final results.

Up until this point, I havenâ€™t found any outliers in the data.  Future 
outliers will be incorporated into the data.

Once imported, the file was separated out first into the sets of ten 
region codes.  These regions were then broken up further into dataframes by state.
